    <h1>Posting from the CMS</h1>
    <p>Creating the inaugural CMS post! I can't say that I love this editing interface to be honest. Hate the Material like inputs and don't like the date and time picker. Specifically that it includes the time and defaults it to 12:00 but if you want to change it you have to use the arrows rather than just typing it, and why do you have to include the time anyway?</p>
<p>On the plus side it was pretty easy to set up. But man I don't like this editing interface.</p>
