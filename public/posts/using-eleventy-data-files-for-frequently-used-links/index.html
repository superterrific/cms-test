    <h1>Using Eleventy data files for frequently used links</h1>
    <p><a href="https://chriskirknielsen.com/blog/building-and-maintaining-components-from-utility-classes-in-eleventy/">This useful post on maintaining utility class components</a> recently made its way into my timeline, inspiring me to write up a similar approach I used to make maintaining this site a little easier.</p>
<p>One of the fun things about creating this site was playing with different approaches, especially with regard to data. In <a href="https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/">Learn Eleventy from Scratch</a> there are several useful examples of how to push the envelope with front matter, data files and remote data. This helped me keep those ideas in mind as I played around with how to build this site.</p>
<p>As I was writing up the <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> section it didn't take long to realize that I was going to be referencing my go-to tools like <a href="">Airtable</a> frequently, so using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-global/">Eleventy's handy global data</a> feature I created a tools.json file in the _data directory.</p>
<p>And here's a sample paragraph in the markdown file from the <a href="">Horse Racing Datasets</a> project page:</p>
<p>This was an excellent time and annoyance saver! I also created a json file for links to my various accounts, as well as one to manage projects on landing pages, more on that one later.</p>
<p>In the meantime if there's anything you reference with regularity, storing it in a json file in your _data directory can make things a little easier!</p>
