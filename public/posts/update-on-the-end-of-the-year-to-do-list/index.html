    <h1>Update on the end of the year to-do list</h1>
    <p>Not long after <a href="/notes/end-of-the-year-to-do-list/">writing about the status of Horse Racing Datasets</a> and how, after a couple of weeks of fiddling with a proof of concept, I had decided to transition it to use markdown files instead of <a href="">Airtable</a>, I decided to give Airtable a proper shot. And in a surprising turn of events <a href="https://twitter.com/superterrific/status/1329799958560649223">figured out how to get it to work</a>.</p>
<p>Surprising because I'm not very good at Javascript, and there aren't any articles that I could find on using Airtable with Eleventy. I did <a href="https://github.com/plloyd11/eat">find a single repository</a> which was the breakthrough moment I needed. I cloned it, played around with it and got my Airtable base to work with it. And thanks to <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/1122">this Github issue</a> and specifically <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/1122#issuecomment-622437989">this comment</a> I was able to make some improvements. This was all very exciting!</p>
<p>I learned quite a bit too, and now I have an apples to apples comparison between using markdown and remote data. If I were starting <a href="">Horse Racing Datasets</a> from scratch I would probably go with markdown to take full advantage of <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/">collections in Eleventy</a>, especially considering that Airtable is <a href="/notes/end-of-the-year-to-do-list/">functioning more like a spreadsheet than a database</a> for this project (and you can always <a href="https://piccalil.li/quick-tip/create-a-json-feed-with-11ty/">turn a collection into a JSON feed</a> to easily share or back-up the data). Admittedly having beginner level Javascript skills certainly tips it towards markdown, but being able to natively use tags and easily control display order is a huge bonus using markdown.</p>
<p>Since I spent last week working on Airtable instead of design I'm pushing back my self-imposed soft deadline of the end of the year. I think mid-Feburary is more likely to have the site redesign fully implemented. But I'm going to add <a href="https://twitter.com/5t3ph/status/1329800237003796480">an article on using Airtable with Eleventy</a> to the end-of-the-year list to make up for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/superterrific/status/1329800837930119172">I did figure out how to filter on the data</a>, using a combination <a href="">Nunjucks</a> and markdown files to create tag pages. I also figured how to do an API call to grab a single, random record (because I'm not yet good enough at Javascript to figure out how to grab a random record from the data in the initial API call ðŸ¤“). Displaying a random item is another thing that's a little easier using collections, or at least <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2020/10/26/selecting-random-posts-in-eleventy">easier to find</a> <a href="https://egghead.io/lessons/11ty-apply-a-filter-to-an-eleventy-11ty-collection">helpful resources</a>).</p>
<p>More to come on all this!</p>
