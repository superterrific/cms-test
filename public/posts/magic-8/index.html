    <h1>Magic 8</h1>
    <p>I rarely use any kind of animations. There are a number of reasons for this. Mostly my mind just doesn’t work in a way that would think “a little flourish or movement here would be just the thing”. Similarly when I look at animation code it doesn’t click for me the way grid or flexbox does.</p>
<p>One of the rare instances where it did occur to me that some animation would be just thing was the Magic 8 ball. And it seemed like straightforward shaking and fading would go a long way. Admittedly, I found some examples and made some adjustments rather than trying to figure out how to write it from scratch. That aside, I think does add to the overall Magic 8 ball-ness, which is nice.</p>
