I'm looking for a headless CMS to use with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). I have a content creation and editing flow that I like, but I might be setting up some sites for people who'd prefer to use a CMS.

To test it out I created a simple site locally that includes:

* A Homepage
* Posts and a post listing page
* Tags and a a tag listing page
* Pagination
* A static page

Steps I took here, probably upload to GitHub and import to Netlify but we'll see!

I've made a post about each of the elements I decided to include, plus a wrap-up to discuss pros and cons. Guess we'll see if I do different posts based on what Netlify has to offer.

* [Images](/posts/images/) - within a template and within a body of the post
* [Snippets](/posts/snippets/) - creating usable text or code
* [Date field](/posts/date-field) - options for handling dates
* [Drafts](/posts/drafts/) - setting up drafts
* [Wrap up](/posts/wrap-up/) - overview, likes and dislikes
