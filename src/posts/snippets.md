I created a couple of [snippets](https://forestry.io/docs/settings/snippets/) and am now testing them out.

## Image snippet

I created a snippet to ensure that images within the body of a post use lazy loading, but it could also be useful for applying a class to the image if necessary.

<img src="/uploads/diagram-airtable.png" alt="A diagram showing data coming from Airtable" loading="lazy">

## Table snippet

Tables come in handy sometimes!
