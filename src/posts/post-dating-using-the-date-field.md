I'm looking for an easy to use headless CMS to use with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). I have a content creation and editing flow that I like that involves [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and [Atom](https://atom.io/), but I might be setting up some sites for people who'd prefer to use a CMS.

I'm looking for something that's both easy to use and easy to set-up (and maintain!). This makes Git-based options attractive, so I'm starting with [Forestry](https://forestry.io).

I created a simple site locally that includes:
* Homepage
* Posts and posts listing page
* Tags and a tags listing page
* Pagination for the posts
* A static page

I uploaded the site to GitHub and imported it to Foresty via their "Import site" flow. From there a created a bunch of posts, tried a bunch of things... it was fun! 

I've made a post about each of the elements I decided to include, plus a wrap-up.

* [Images](/posts/images/) - within a template and within a body of the post
* [Snippets](/posts/snippets/) - creating a couple of snippets
* Date field
* Drafts!
* [Wrap up](/posts/wrap-up/)
