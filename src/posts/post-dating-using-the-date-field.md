I'm looking for a headless CMS to use with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). I have a content creation and editing flow that I like, but I might be setting up some sites for people who'd prefer to use a CMS.

I'm looking for something that's both easy to use and easy to set-up (and maintain!). This makes Git-based options attractive, so I'm starting with [Forestry](https://forestry.io).

To test it out I created a simple site locally that includes:
* A Homepage
* Posts and a post listing page
* Tags and a a tag listing page
* Pagination
* A static page

I uploaded the site to GitHub and imported it to Foresty via the "Import site" flow. From there I created a bunch of posts, tried a bunch of things and figured out what Forestry has to offer. It was fun! 

I've made a post about each of the elements I decided to include, plus a wrap-up to dicuss pros and cons.

* [Images](/posts/images/) - within a template and within a body of the post
* [Snippets](/posts/snippets/) - creating a couple of snippets
* [Date field](/posts/date-field)
* [Drafts](/posts/drafts/)
* [Wrap up](/posts/wrap-up/)
