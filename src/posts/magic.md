I rarely use any kind of animations. There are a number of reasons for this. Mostly my mind just doesn’t work in a way that would think “a little flourish or movement here would be just the thing”. Similarly when I look at animation code it doesn’t click for me the way grid or flexbox does.

One of the rare instances where it did occur to me that some animation would be just thing was the Magic 8 ball. And it seemed like straightforward shaking and fading would go a long way. Admittedly, I found some examples and made some adjustments rather than trying to figure out how to write it from scratch. That aside, I think does add to the overall Magic 8 ball-ness, which is nice.
