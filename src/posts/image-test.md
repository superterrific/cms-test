I added an image to the Media gallery and then added to a the [Creating a new post](/posts/creating-a-new-post/) post. The image was in the proper directory but didn't display. Double checked the settings and everything was in order.

I added the image to the /uploads directory via GitHub and it worked. So odd.

**Update** I think I had the settings wrong, I've updated the image path and am now trying again. I uploaded the Airtable diagram via the Media library and am associated it here.

![Diagram of data coming from Airtable.](/uploads/diagram-airtable.png)

It worked ðŸŽ‰

Also, second strike for a new post not picking up the "markdown" setting and defaulting to WYSIWYG.
