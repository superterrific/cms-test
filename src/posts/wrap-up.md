Here's a list, come back and clean it up...

* Easy to set up, I didn't read any instructions and used the "add your site" flow and was up and running quickly. I made a whoopsie and it took my a while to get preview working, but it would've just worked had I not flubbed dependencies in package.json
* I don't love the editing interface but not a deal breaker
  * Would like to be able to set the post listing in the admin to default to listing by date
  * Would like the publish date to display in the post listing page, even better would be to figure what fields from the post template frontmatter display on the listing page 
* I set new posts to use markdown and they still default to html
* Preview is a little slow and quirky, I think if I were making a site for someone coming from WordPress they would find that annoying
