Now that I've gotten the site set-up and the CMS integrated I have a good idea of the pros and cons.

First I created the site locally including some content pages with tags, static pages and pagination. Then I uploaded it to GitHub and imported it. From there I played around with a variety of settings and approaches.

## Likes

For the most part I think there's a lot to like, especially that's it easy to set up.

* Getting up and running is easy when importing a site.
* If you're familiar with CMSs in general the configuration of setting up directories and pages is straightforward.
* There seems to be a good amount of flexibility for setting up frontmatter and creating snippets.

## Dislikes

There were just a few small things I didn't like or wished I could configure. I think it's an OK trade-off for the simplicity and easy set-up.
