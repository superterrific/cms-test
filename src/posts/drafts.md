Forestry provides [Previews](https://forestry.io/docs/previews/about-previews/) that are [relatively easy to set up](https://forestry.io/docs/previews/instant-previews/). Hugo and Jekyll have [draft capability](https://forestry.io/docs/editing/markdown-editor/#drafting-and-publishing-content) built in, but with Eleventy you'll need to roll your own. If I can do it so can you!

## Preview Settings

In package.json I added the following to scripts:

```html
"forestry:preview": "eleventy --serve"
```

And in the Configuration section withing Settings > Preview I added "npm run forestry:preview". Below are my Preview settings...

## Draft Settings

There are plenty of posts about how to [schedule posts](https://remysharp.com/2019/06/26/scheduled-and-draft-11ty-posts) or [hide future content](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2020/08/07/hiding-future-content-with-eleventy) in Eleventy.

I ended up using an approach that uses environment and a boolean draft field in front matter to [filter out posts with draft: "true"](https://11ta.netlify.app/2020/09/20/v110-brings-draft-posts/), but I also tried a similar one that [flips permalink to "false"](https://rusingh.com/2020/05/14/eleventy-exclude-draft-collection-items-programmatically/).

The permalink approach, which is used in Ru Singh's [Forestry Eleventy starter Smix](https://github.com/hirusi/smix-eleventy-starter), doesn't keep the post from publishing ([which is noted here](https://rusingh.com/2020/05/14/eleventy-exclude-draft-collection-items-programmatically/)). In my case that meant it was displayed on the post listing page. I probably could've figured out how to keep it from displaying in the listing, but decided to try another approach. This brought me to the filtering approach.

First I set up a draft field in Forestry and set it to default to true. This ensures that any new posts will not inadvertently be published to production. Here's the frontmatter from this post...

```html
draft: false

```

In eleventy.js I modified my collections to the following...

```js
  config.addCollection('posts', collection => {
    if (process.env.ELEVENTY_ENV !== 'production')
      return [...collection.getFilteredByGlob('./src/posts/*.md')];
    else
      return [...collection.getFilteredByGlob('./src/posts/*.md')].filter((post) => !post.data.draft);
  });
```

And added this to my netlify.toml (which I picked up from the [Smix starter](https://github.com/hirusi/smix-eleventy-starter))...

```html
[context.production.environment]
  ELEVENTY_ENV = "production" # excludes Forestry drafts from production build
```

And so far so good ðŸŽ‰

As long as the post is set to "draft" it's viewable in the Preview site but doesn't "publish" to production. I have a test post that I've updated and saved a couple of times to test it out. I also set a previously published post to draft and that worked too.

Here's my draft post that will remain drafted...
